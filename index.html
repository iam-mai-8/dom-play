          <p> <span data-actor="strange"> Dr. Stephen Strange: No, I reject it because I do not believe 
            in fairy tales about chakras, or energy, or the power of belief. 
            There is no such thing as spirit! We are made of matter, 
            and nothing more. We’re just another tiny, momentary speck within an indifferent universe. </span> </p>
          <p> <span data-actor="one"> The Ancient One: You think too little of yourself. </span> </p>
          <p> <span data-actor="strange"> Dr. Stephen Strange: Oh, you think you see through me, do you? 
            Well, you don’t. But I see through you!!! What did you just do to me?!? </span> </p>
          <p> <span data-actor="one"> The Ancient One: I pushed your astral form out of your physical form. </span> </p>
         
          <p> <span data-actor="strange"> Dr. Stephen Strange: What’s in that tea? Psilocybin? LSD? </span> </p>

            <p> <span data-actor="one"> The Ancient One: Just tea. With a little honey. </span> </p>

              <p> <span data-actor="strange"> Dr. Stephen Strange: What just happened? </span> </p>

                <p> <span data-actor="one"> The Ancient One: For a moment, you entered the astral dimension. </span> </p>

                <p> <span data-actor="strange"> Dr. Stephen Strange: What?? </span> </p>

                <p> <span data-actor="one">The Ancient One: A place where the soul exists apart from the body. </span> </p>
       
                <p> <span data-actor="strange"> Dr. Stephen Strange: Why are you doing this to me? </span> </p>

                <p> <span data-actor="one"> The Ancient One: To show you just how much you don’t know. Open your eye.</span> </p>
                
                <p> <span data-actor="strange">Dr. Stephen Strange: No! No… No! Shit! Oh god! Oh god! Oh god! This isn’t real it isn’t real it isn’t </span> </p>
        
                <p> <span data-actor="mordo"> Mordo: His heart rate are getting dangerously high. </span> </p>
                <p> <span data-actor="one">The Ancient One: He looks alright to me. You think you know how the world works? You think that this material universe is all there is? What is real? What mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses? At the root of existence, mind and matter meet. Thoughts shape reality. This universe is only one of an infinite number. Worlds without end. Some benevolent and life-giving, others filled with malice and hunger. Dark places, where powers older than time lie… ravenous… and waiting. Who are you in this vast multiverse, Mr. Strange? Have you seen that before in a gift shop? </span> </p>
